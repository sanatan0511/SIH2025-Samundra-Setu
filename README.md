# SIH 2025 Project: ℹ️ Ocean Exploration using AI

## Problem Statement
The oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and contain vast, largely unexplored ecosystems. Efficient monitoring and analysis of oceanographic data are critical for environmental conservation, resource management, and scientific discovery. Traditional approaches are often time-consuming, expensive, or limited in scope.  

Our project leverages **advanced AI and multi-modal learning techniques** to analyze ocean data, providing actionable insights on oceanic conditions, environmental changes, and resource availability. The goal is to enable **real-time, data-driven decision making** for sustainable ocean exploration and conservation.
